      <tr>
      <td><b> I like singing and dancing </b>. I sing at home and at a local karaoke club sometimes. As for dancing, I go to the local youth club with my friends and we dance there. My favourite types of music are disco, pop and rock. I can also play the guitar a little bit. </td>
      <td><b> My hobby is watching films or TV series </b>. I really enjoy it, because it's one of the best ways of spending my free time, also it helps to relax, what is especially necessary after a long tiring day. </td>
      <td><b> I like swimming and skating </b>. There is a sports center in my town where I can do both of these sports. It contains a swimming-pool and a skating-rink. I think sport is a great opportunity to stay healthy and in good mood. </td>
      <td><b> Listening to musics </b>. I love music because music can relax my mind. It is also an interesting and exciting hobby. Sometimes, I will listen to music while study or doing my homework. I do not feel pressure when I listen to the music. </td>
